This program and third party software used in addition are free software.

Textallion will be installed on your system, together with Cygwin (some
unix tools for advanced scriptings). The main location will be 
C:\cygwin, the default folder for this project. 

This part alone will be able to generate the HTML files, and requires
around 80 Mb on the disk.

220 Mb of optionnal, but recommended, software may be downloaded from
the main installer. Installing everything will take about 590 Mb on
the disk. It's quite huge, but MikTeX alone (pdf/TeX tools) is already
very big.
You can re-use those piece of software for other purposes.

If you keep the following files in the same folder as this setup
program (textallion_setup.exe), those files won't be downloaded again:
- basic-miktex-*****.exe 
- calibre-*****.msi  
- geany-*****_setup.exe  
- SumatraPDF-*****-install.exe


The file textallion_setup.exe was checked with an antivirus (Avira) and on 
http://www.virustotal.com/, and shouldn't contain any known viruses.
