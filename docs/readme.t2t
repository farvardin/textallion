Textallion is a document generator, designed to output HTML, PDF and EPUB formats.

Please read the documentations in the ./docs folder; these are normal txt files and should be self-explanatory:

- documentation_en.t2t is for the English version (it's a normal txt file)
- documentation_fr.t2t is for the French version

- textallion_cyoa_en.t2t is for the Gamebook (CYOA) module
- textallion_cyoa_fr.t2t is for the Gamebook module (French version)

You need python 2 to use this program and LaTeX to be able to generate
pdf files.

You can run textallion_install.sh to install everything into /usr/share/textallion
or just run the makefile from the sample folder to get started.

Type:

	- "make html" to generate the html manual for English
	- "make pdf" to generate the pdf version (requires LaTeX)
	- "make xetex" to generate an alternative pdf version (requires XeTeX)
	- "make epub" to generate an epub document (requires Calibre)

Edit the makefile and change "DOCUMENT = sample_en" to 
"DOCUMENT = sample_fr" in order to generate the French version of those 
documents.

You can also run core/textallion.sh (or just 'textallion' if you've already
used the installation script) for a little front-end.
