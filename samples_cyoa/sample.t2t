== Introduction ==


% This is a comment. It begins with a "% ".
% We'll use comments to give further informations about how to use textallion.

% Chapter == Introduction == is the only chapter you must keep this way to ensure textallion will start correctly. Don't rename it to something else, except for "intro" or "0". Therefore, all the keywords starting by "Intro" will be reserved for this first chapter.

% Insert your own logo / picture instead of this one :
{->--}  [../media/sample_game_cover.jpg] {-<--} 

- Read the [#instructions] or start the game 1 


== 1 ==

% after this part, you can delete everything from this sample and write your own game!
% Write your story like you would do with a normal text editor.

This is the first chapter of your story.°°note1°°It will present various ways to use txt2tags and textallion to create CYOA (choose your own adventure). Check the source code of this sample, and read the comments about various tips for using textallion°°

% We just wrote a note here. Just start your note with °° write note1, note2, note3 etc (you'll have to increment this yourself, hopefully you shouldn't need to write that many notes in your game...), write °°, then the content of your note, and °° again. 

You are walking on the bank of a river, in a sunny autumn day. You can see a [#man] holding a landing net. Yet he's not really fishing, he's only collecting small twigs.

- Enter the [#forest] nearby.
- Explore the [green hills|#hills] close to the river: 5
- Ask the [#man] about the [twigs #8] he's getting from the river: [#8]

% We just wrote 5 different ways to express a link to a new chapter:
% - 5 at the end of a line (starting with "-") will link to the chapter == 5 ==
% - [#6] could have been written just "6" in this context, but by writing it this way, you can place it anywhere in your text. It will link to chapter == 6 == of course.
% - [#forest] will be linked to a chapter called == forest == 
% - [green hills|#hills] (or [green hills | #hills]) will link to chapter == hills == and will display "green hills" to the read.
% - similarly, [twigs #6] will link to chapter == 6 ==, and display "twigs" to the reader

% The first 2 ways (5 and [#6]) have the advantage to be more like traditional CYOA gamebooks, and allow your work to be printed. The other ways will only be available for electronic ebooks or through a web-browser.


== 2 ==

There is nothing interesting in this chapter. In fact this is only a test chapter.

This template story is almost empty yet, but you can improve it yourself!
