I'm falling down. Not very far from the “ground”, fortunately for me. Some thick, heavy ropes are softening my falling. I've probably missed my step, because I'm absent-minded most of the time now.

I ring the bell at the door. Beatrix doesn't seem very happy to see me. She was a good friend of mine before, so I don't understand her new reluctance.

She wears a pretty, light, white and gray dress, and I sense such poetry in the air that I want to tell her about what I have in my mind.

This deck is usually reserved to the first-class passengers. I hope some officers won't notice me or I'll be in great trouble.

I've got this job on a ship to pay my travel to the Great Continent, which had been rediscovered only a few centuries ago. Meanwhile, I've always been curious about the life there, to discover if people were like us or if their culture was far too exotic to be able to live far over there. I've also tried to learn bits of their difficult language, and forced myself to use it on a daily basis. So I moved to Iricimia, which has a similar language, and even if I still don't master it, I lived there for a while, then decided to embark on this ship.

*choice
	# After some time, we arrive to New Londrin Haven, and I enter the city triumphally: 25

Entering the tavern, I see some of my former comrades from the ship. Surprisingly, they are not that much hostile to my presence. We take a beer together, then an other, and I end the night dancing on the tables, to the great joys of the maids here who are clapping their graceful hands in rhythm.

I appreciate this simple life, and no longer fear the blue terror I used to feel in the past.

The docks are not a pleasant place for a delicate person like me. I get the feeling that I may become an easy prey for most of the vultures here. I notice a handsome woman waiting on the pier. Some sailors I met on the ship are calling me, while entering a tavern.

Impassive to the human's emotions, the ship is reaching the morning mists of the other continent. Setting my foot on the pier for the first time after three weeks of spiritual torture, I feel dizzy and completely at loss. There is a big poster on the grey wall, and an exit to the rest of the town.

The sun is high in the sky, yet I feel a chill devoring my neck and my ribs. I remember my childhood in Francimia, my games in the trees and between the rare green hills of the family's domain. Later, still in the trees, reading fantasy books lying on the red and purple carpet in my hut 8 meters above the ground. I remember my mother calling me, with her high pitched voice, to eat the "Gargouaillotte à la Pisaille", a local dish.

I suddenly feel I'm turning around.

The blue ocean, spreading endlessly toward the all directions, is reflecting the sun like a glittering chainmail.

“Hey Francimi bastard! Come here!”, they shout.

Surrounded by those Scottani and Iricimi strangers, I don't feel at ease in this place. Their green and dark-orange helmets make me nervous. I don't really need to obey, they're just basic sailors like me. But could I bear the insults?

This city is bigger than the standard we can expect on the Old Continent. Huge, pompous, airships are crossing the airs, but also a few aeroplanes, more than in Euralinia.

The ship was probably not having enough goods and supply, and it was not a surprise it would need to travel back to our country of origin.

Disappointed and tired, the sailors are leaving the boat in a disciplined row. Used to small local travels, they won't see this new Continent everybody is talking about. I'm nonetheless happy to be here, and to get rid of them all.

After a few researchs in the libraries and museum, I discover this society was founded one thousand years ago, after its physical separation from the Old Continent. It grew at a normal pace, without any noticeable events. More worrying is the fact that 10 years ago, a new sect, called the Indigo Love Syndicate, spread quickly across the continent, both among the populace and the elite. Discrete at the beginning, the sect is now one of the major political power in place.
