I ring the bell at the door. Beatrix doesn't seem very happy to see me. She was a good friend of mine before, so I don't understand her new reluctance.

She wears a pretty, light, white and gray dress, and I sense such poetry in the air that I want to tell her about what I have in my mind.

\begin{gbitemize}

This deck is usually reserved to the first-class passengers. I hope some officers won't notice me or I'll be in great trouble.

I've got this job on a ship to pay my travel to the Great Continent, which had been rediscovered only a few centuries ago. Meanwhile, I've always been curious about the life there, to discover if people were like us or if their culture was far too exotic to be able to live far over there. I've also tried to learn bits of their difficult language, and forced myself to use it on a daily basis. So I moved to Iricimia, which has a similar language, and even if I still don't master it, I lived there for a while, then decided to embark on this ship.

\begin{gbitemize}
\gbitem After some time, we arrive to New Londrin Haven, and I enter the city triumphally: \textbf{\htmladdnormallink{25}{\#25}}
\gbitem But before that, I could explore the haven a bit, adding less prestige to my arrival: \textbf{\htmladdnormallink{27}{\#27}}

We enter a snobbish tea-house, in a touristic area. We quickly get bored in this place, so I propose we search a more pleasant place to entertain ourselves.

\begin{gbitemize}
\gbitem Propose her appartment: \textbf{\htmladdnormallink{42}{\#42}}
\gbitem Propose my appartment: \textbf{\htmladdnormallink{38}{\#38}}

Entering the tavern, I see some of my former comrades from the ship. Surprisingly, they are not that much hostile to my presence. We take a beer together, then an other, and I end the night dancing on the tables, to the great joys of the maids here who are clapping their graceful hands in rhythm.

I appreciate this simple life, and no longer fear the blue terror I used to feel in the past.

The docks are not a pleasant place for a delicate person like me. I get the feeling that I may become an easy prey for most of the vultures here. I notice a handsome woman waiting on the pier. Some sailors I met on the ship are calling me, while entering a tavern.

Impassive to the human's emotions, the ship is reaching the morning mists of the other continent. Setting my foot on the pier for the first time after three weeks of spiritual torture, I feel dizzy and completely at loss. There is a big poster on the grey wall, and an exit to the rest of the town.

The captain, arriving a moment later, feels sorry for his men's rude behavior. Bowing deeply, he requests my opinion on the route to take. Am I dreaming? Is he insane? Or maybe it's just a sick pity.

Should we head:

\begin{gbitemize}
\gbitem North, to our original the destination, the New Continent: \textbf{\htmladdnormallink{11}{\#11}}
\gbitem South, to reach a little island he's just discovered with his telescope: \textbf{\htmladdnormallink{30}{\#30}}

The sun is high in the sky, yet I feel a chill devoring my neck and my ribs. I remember my childhood in Francimia, my games in the trees and between the rare green hills of the family's domain. Later, still in the trees, reading fantasy books lying on the red and purple carpet in my hut 8 meters above the ground. I remember my mother calling me, with her high pitched voice, to eat the "Gargouaillotte à la Pisaille", a local dish.

I suddenly feel I'm turning around.

“Hey Francimi bastard! Come here!”, they shout.

Surrounded by those Scottani and Iricimi strangers, I don't feel at ease in this place. Their green and dark-orange helmets make me nervous. I don't really need to obey, they're just basic sailors like me. But could I bear the insults?

After being knocked down by a pirate with putrid teeth, I'm led to their lair, which is hidden in a big city I've never been before. Could it be I'm on the new Continent after all~?

I was separated from the other sailors to avoid rebellion, and met people with langage and culture I couldn't understand at all.

\begin{gbitemize}
\gbitem I hear the pirates are planning to sell me as a slave: \textbf{\htmladdnormallink{16}{\#16}}

Stealing is easy here: it seems nobody is on guard so I can lure many people. In fact I didn't know the citizen weren't aware of misdeeds just because the police was so effective that criminals were caught within 48 hours.

My sinful mood entangling my mind into so a well-known depression, I'm wandering in town without purpose. I'm crossing an ornamented iron bridge. A lamplighter is bringing light to the streets, without a smile. The dusk is leaving, replaced soon by the full night. The indigo sky is matching the indigo river and I'm longing for such an harmony.

\begin{itshape}Am I lucky today? When I get a die out of my pocket, I can be considered lucky when I cast a 5 or 6.\end{itshape}

Beatrix' appartment is cozy and modern: lots of wooden furniture, ornamented with copper. She begins to remove her clothes, then think again and tells me she prefer we have a drink in a tavern.

The western side of the sea is famous for its tricky tornados and whirlpools.
The destiny of our boat is yet challenged by some humanly disaster, when a pirate ship is attacking us.

The ruffians arrive on board, full of hate and violence, and even if we try to rebel, we're not strong enough to contain their assault for very long.

Mr and Mrs Caesar own a house which is bigger than anything I had already seen: a private aircraft landing place, a tower in the garden, electricity everywhere, for growing plants and vegetables...

They take me to their workshop, where I'm supposed to assembly stuffs and repair all the gadgets they have in the house: mecanical birds, electrical machines, phonographs...

After one year here, they begin to trust me.

They welcome me with great attention, and while taking my name, they show me a list of jobs in the surroundings.
I'm probably lucky, because there was recently a vacant place as a librarian in the main library.

After making me sign a few papers, they show me the road on a map.

After a few years as a prisoner, I am more reasonnable, and seek redemption when I'm free again. Probably the best for me is to travel back home, and begin a new life there. Will I be librarian, or adventurer there? I still can't decide.

Yawning and stretching, I awake with a good mood. I haven't discovered a new Continent, I haven't experienced great adventures, but I met some people who weren't bad at all.

Day after day, I meet my friend Beatrix more and more often, and she tries to cope with my grim humor. She always tells me our story is really like an happy end after all!
